Input variables:
* x_mb
    * shape: (32,16,16) 
        * 32 minibatch size, 
        * 16 is largest number of measurements for one patient in the dataset
        * 16 is the number of covariates
    * mini-batch that holds the covariates for the patients

* x_mi_mb
    * shape: (32,16,16) 
    * indicates which of the covariates are missing
    * TODO: How is the data treated otherwise? Mean replacement?
        * Believe so.
    * Same shape as x_mb, 1 indicates missing

k_mb:
    shape: (32, 1)
    indicates: what event occured
        * I believe 0 indicates no event


Figuring out:
    * What happens after inputs go in
    * Gamma, alpha, beta
    * How the masks are made and used
        * mask1: conditional probability?
        * mask2: log-likelihood loss
        * mask3: loss_3; rank loss
