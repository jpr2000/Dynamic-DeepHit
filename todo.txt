Re-run our previous code
	Will have to run tutorial
	Then run Zhale's code to get predictions

	*** Could be easier to create general script to run in background with different arguments

Modify code to fit current understanding
	*** Data formatted correctly
		Do NOT need to forward-fill missing data
		Need to change prediction times to make sense
		Run on something _more_ than the 5-day cutoff we currently use

	Hyperparameter tuning
		Best to lookup a guide to maybe improve this
			Need to know best place to start
			Karparthy's guide still is looked up to

Architectural Changes

Literature Review on different architectures





List of improvements:
	Change evaluation times
	Fix problems with dataset
		Fix forward-fill
		Fix time set-up (?)
